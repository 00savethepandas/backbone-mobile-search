A sample Backbone + Micro-Templating + jQuery Mobile project using the Flickr API (still in the early refactoring phases)

This is one of the first Backbone sample projects to include information on how to override jQuery Mobile's standard routing so that your app can still make use of all of Backbone's goodness without having to hack up jQMobile directly.
